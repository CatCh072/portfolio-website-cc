                    Olive was shared with fellow colleagues for feedback and recommendations for improvement. Having others in the industry review, is very helpful as they might see things that participants from user testing may not. They
                    can also advise on elements that might have (or have not) worked through their own experience.

                    Olive was created for a variety of users that would like to improve their health. During the early stages of development, accessibility was always an important factor. I have tried my best to keep ample signifiers and
                    the color theme simple and clean as possible but there is always room for improvement.

                    A feature to input information (for reminders) in quicker and/or easier way would be helpful for those that constantly have new reminders. Health care professionals, trainers, etc. could to send their advised
                    routine/regimens directly to their patient/client and the user will have the option to accept and edit as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UI for Olive will have to continuously grow. Keeping in mind all the different users, Olive needs to be clean and easy to read for our more mature users but also has to be up to date (design trends that are accessibile
                    for everyone) and interetesing for our younger audience.
