            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Our health-conscious users need a way to access, enter and share their health information and a way to form more healthy habits because they wish to stay on top of their health and wellness for greater balance in their busy lives.
                We will know this to be true when we see our users using our app to achieve their health goals and make less inquires to their doctors.

            <h3>Possible Problems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not everyone is the same. Everyone is created differently and require different needs.</li>
                <li>An interface with too much information or not organized icons can lead to user confusion and frustration.</li>
                <li>Personal information is always a target for hackers.  We must find a way to access, input, store, and share information securely.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Potential Solutions- Goal</h3>
            <p>Olive app will let users personalize the app to their specific needs.  
                Users will be able to create personal alerts to build healthy habits for themseleves and their dependent/s.  
                Users will also be able to share their progress with their doctor or trainer and recieve the latest health information.</p>

            <h3>Future Iterations</h3>
            <p>A feature to input information (for reminders) in quicker and/or easier way would be helpful for those that constantly have new reminders. 
                Health care professionals, trainers, etc. could to send their advised routine/regimens directly to their patient/client and the user will have the option to accept and edit as needed.
            </p>
            <p>UI for Olive will have to continuously grow. Keeping in mind all the different users, Olive needs to be clean and easy to read for our more mature users but 
                also has to be up to date (design trends that are accessibile for everyone) and interetesing for our younger audience.
